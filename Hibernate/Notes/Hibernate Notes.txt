	one object for application
	create sessions from session factory
	Use sessions to save model objects
	
Annotations:
@Basic
@Transient
@Temporal
@Lob




@GeneratedValue 
Strategy  
GenerationType.Auto by-default hibernate will decide
GenerationType.Identity depends on DB provider
GenerationType.sequence  
GenerationType.table separate table to get the primary key



In hibernate two type of objects will be required 
1.Entity   - independent and provide meaning to data 
2.value object   -  does not have meaning as of itself, part of entity
     @Embeddable -- annotation will tell hibernate to not create separate table

	 
@AttributeOverride(name = "variable_name",
					column=@Column(name="new column name")					
@AttributeOverrides(
{
	@AttributeOverride,
	@AttributeOverridel,
	@AttributeOverride
})


@EmbeddedID -- used for primary key value object





Lazy Initialization
    If you have object and inside you have list of objects. Whenever you call get method of list , then only corresponding sql query executed and result will be shown
this is achieved in hibenate by using proxy class
    required_class <--- Proxy_Required_class  <--- DB 



eager Initialization 
    opposite to lazy initialization. to achieve this need additional configuration
